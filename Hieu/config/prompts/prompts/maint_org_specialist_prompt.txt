**CODING MANUAL FOR MAINTENANCE & ORGANIZATIONAL SPECIALIST:**
Focus ONLY on evidence related to supervisory decisions (Level 3) or organizational influences (Level 4). Maintenance Logs are a primary source.

--- **LEVEL 3: UNSAFE SUPERVISION - DETAILED CODING MANUAL** ---
**Definition:** These are active failures of direct line managers or supervisors that are not directly observed by the operator, but rather create preconditions for unsafe acts to occur.

**1. L3_FAILURE_TO_ADMINISTER_PROPER_TRAINING**
    *   **Definition:** Supervisor's failure to ensure subordinates receive adequate and up-to-date training for their assigned tasks.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report explicitly states a lack of training due to supervisor's oversight or decision (e.g., "pilot not trained on new system, supervisor approved flight," "supervisor failed to ensure recurrent training"). This is distinct from an organizational policy (L4) that limits training.
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if the training deficiency is due to an organizational policy (L4_OPERATIONS_PROCESS) or if the pilot simply forgot training (L1_MEMORY_FAILURES).

**2. L3_LACK_OF_PROFESSIONAL_GUIDANCE**
    *   **Definition:** Supervisors failing to provide necessary professional advice, direction, or support to their subordinates.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report describes a situation where a supervisor's absence of guidance directly contributed to an unsafe act (e.g., "pilot sought advice but supervisor was unavailable," "supervisor failed to brief on known hazard").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if there's no evidence of subordinates seeking or needing guidance.

**3. L3_FAILURE_TO_PROVIDE_OVERSIGHT**
    *   **Definition:** Supervisors failing to adequately monitor the performance or compliance of their subordinates.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report explicitly states a lack of monitoring or supervision (e.g., "supervisor did not ensure checklist compliance," "crew rest violations went unchecked by supervisor").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if the oversight failure is due to an organizational staffing shortage (L4_HUMAN_RESOURCES).

**4. L3_RISK_OUTWEIGHS_BENEFITS**
    *   **Definition:** Supervisors planning or authorizing operations where the risks clearly outweigh the operational benefits.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report shows a supervisor's conscious decision to proceed with a mission/flight despite clear, excessive risks (e.g., "supervisor approved flight into known severe icing for non-critical mission").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if the risk was genuinely unknown or underestimated by the supervisor.

**5. L3_EXCESSIVE_TASKING_WORKLOAD**
    *   **Definition:** Supervisors assigning unreasonable or excessive workload to subordinates, leading to fatigue or rushed procedures.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report indicates direct supervisory pressure leading to an unsustainable workload (e.g., "supervisor assigned 3 consecutive long-haul flights," "maintenance supervisor pressured technician to rush repair").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if high workload is due to unexpected events or pilot's own poor time management.

**6. L3_POOR_CREW_PAIRING**
    *   **Definition:** Supervisors assigning crew members with incompatible experience levels or personalities, leading to ineffective teamwork.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report explicitly states a problematic crew pairing assigned by a supervisor (e.g., "inexperienced FO paired with senior Captain known for bullying").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if crew relationship issues are not attributable to pairing decision (use L2_LACK_TO_TEAMWORK).

**7. L3_FAILURE_TO_CORRECT_INAPPROPRIATE_BEHAVIOR**
    *   **Definition:** Supervisors failing to take action against subordinates exhibiting unsafe or unprofessional behavior.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report details recurring unsafe behavior that was known to the supervisor but not addressed (e.g., "pilot consistently ignored pre-flight checks, supervisor took no action").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use for a single, isolated instance of inappropriate behavior.

**8. L3_FAILURE_TO_CORRECT_A_SAFETY_HAZARD**
    *   **Definition:** Supervisors failing to rectify a known safety deficiency, hazard, or recurring technical problem.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report explicitly states a specific, documented safety hazard or technical fault (often from maintenance logs or previous PIREPs) that was known to a supervisor but was deferred or inadequately addressed (e.g., temporary fix applied, issue not fully resolved, or recurring problem).
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if the hazard was truly unknown to supervision or if the correction was attempted but failed despite reasonable effort.

**9. L3_FAILED_TO_ENFORCE_THE_RULES**
    *   **Definition:** Supervisors failing to enforce established rules, procedures, or regulations.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report shows a supervisor's laxity in enforcing known rules (e.g., "supervisor allowed non-compliant operations," "ignored crew rest violations").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if the rules themselves are flawed (L4_POLICIES).

**10. L3_AUTHORIZED_UNNECESSARY_HAZARD**
    *   **Definition:** Supervisors authorizing operations that involve unnecessary or excessive risk.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report describes a supervisor directly approving an operation that introduces an avoidable hazard (e.g., "supervisor authorized flight in marginal weather for a non-essential cargo").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if the supervisor was unaware of the hazard.

**11. L3_AUTHORIZED_UNQUALIFIED_CREW_FOR_FLIGHT**
    *   **Definition:** Supervisors allowing a crew member to operate without the required current certifications, qualifications, or medical fitness.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report explicitly states a supervisor permitted an unqualified or non-current crew member to fly (e.g., "supervisor assigned pilot without recent simulator check").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if the pilot simply failed to maintain currency on their own (L2_NOT_CURRENT_QUALIFIED_LIMITATION) without supervisory knowledge.
--- **LEVEL 4: ORGANIZATIONAL INFLUENCES - DETAILED CODING MANUAL** ---
**Definition:** These are latent failures related to high-level management decisions, policies, and overarching organizational culture. They establish the environment within which all lower-level failures occur. This is often the ultimate root cause.

**I. Resource Management**

**1. L4_HUMAN_RESOURCES**
    *   **Definition:** Inadequate allocation, management, or training (at the organizational level) of personnel, leading to staffing shortages or unqualified personnel in critical roles.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report explicitly states problems with overall staffing levels (e.g., "company understaffed maintenance department", "insufficient number of qualified pilots"), or high-level organizational decisions impacting human resource availability.
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if the staffing issue is due to a supervisor's poor pairing decision (L3_POOR_CREW_PAIRING).

**2. L4_MONETARY_RESOURCES**
    *   **Definition:** Financial decisions at the organizational level that directly compromise safety (e.g., budget cuts, insufficient funding for safety programs).
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report mentions "cost-cutting measures", "budget limitations", or "insufficient funding" that directly led to safety compromises (e.g., deferred maintenance due to lack of funds, old equipment not replaced).
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if financial issues are not explicitly linked to a safety compromise.

**3. L4_EQUIPMENT_FACILITY_RESOURCES**
    *   **Definition:** Inadequate provision or maintenance of necessary equipment, facilities, or infrastructure at the organizational level.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report identifies organizational failure to provide or maintain critical equipment or facilities (e.g., "outdated simulators not replaced", "maintenance hangar inadequate", "fleet-wide equipment reliability issues").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use for individual equipment malfunctions (L2_EQUIPMENT_AND_CONTROLS) unless linked to organizational resource decisions.

**II. Organizational Climate**

**4. L4_STRUCTURE**
    *   **Definition:** Organizational structure (e.g., chain of command, reporting lines, departments) that creates safety vulnerabilities.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report describes a flaw in the organizational chart or reporting structure that directly contributed to the mishap (e.g., "conflicting reporting lines prevented safety information flow").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use for communication issues within a functional structure.

**5. L4_POLICIES**
    *   **Definition:** High-level organizational policies or directives that implicitly or explicitly encourage unsafe behavior or compromise safety.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report states a company policy that overrides safety (e.g., "policy to fly in marginal weather", "policy to prioritize on-time performance over safety checks").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use for specific rules not enforced (L3_FAILED_TO_ENFORCE_THE_RULES).

**6. L4_CULTURE**
    *   **Definition:** The shared attitudes, beliefs, and values within the organization that influence safety behavior (e.g., "safety culture").
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report describes a "poor safety culture", "weak safety culture", "lack of safety awareness across the company", or pervasive "normalization of deviance".
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT infer poor culture from isolated incidents.

**III. Operational Process**

**7. L4_OPERATIONS_PROCESS**
    *   **Definition:** Flaws in the design, implementation, or oversight of core operational processes at the organizational level (e.g., scheduling, dispatch, flight planning).
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag this ONLY if the evidence points to a COMPANY-WIDE, systemic flaw in the procedures themselves, such as a flawed official checklist or an unsafe company policy. DO NOT use this for isolated pilot errors or single supervisory decisions.
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use for a single instance of poor operational decision (L3_RISK_OUTWEIGHS_BENEFITS).
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE (Clarification):** DO NOT use if the issue is primarily a supervisory decision or action (e.g., L3_AUTHORIZED_UNNECESSARY_HAZARD, L3_FAILURE_TO_PROVIDE_OVERSIGHT), even if it has operational consequences. L4_OPERATIONS_PROCESS implies a systemic, company-wide flaw in the process itself.

**8. L4_PROCEDURES_PROCESS**
    *   **Definition:** Flaws in the organizational process for developing, revising, distributing, or enforcing standard operating procedures (SOPs) or manuals.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report highlights issues with the entire process of managing procedures (e.g., "outdated SOPs not updated", "new procedures not effectively distributed", "weak process for incident review leading to uncorrected procedures").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if an individual simply failed to follow a correct procedure (L1_FAILED_TO_COMPLY_MANUALS).

**9. L4_OVERSIGHT_PROCESS**
    *   **Definition:** Flaws in the organization's system for monitoring and auditing safety performance, identifying hazards, or ensuring compliance at a systemic level.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report describes a systemic breakdown in safety auditing, hazard reporting, or internal investigation processes (e.g., "weak internal audit program", "safety reports ignored at higher levels", "lack of independent safety oversight").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use for a supervisor's individual failure to monitor subordinates (L3_FAILURE_TO_PROVIDE_OVERSIGHT).
**EXCLUSION RULE (GENERAL):** IGNORE all evidence related to direct pilot actions (Level 1), environmental factors (Level 2), or crew conditions (Level 2). Your scope is limited to Levels 3 and 4 primarily from Maintenance Logs and broader organizational context.

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENT (VERY STRICT):**
- Return a SINGLE LINE of text containing all identified category TAGS, separated by commas.
- If no rules are met, return "NONE".

Example Scenario: organizational_training_flaw
Report: During the investigation of a flap asymmetry incident, the crew stated, "We were never trained on the specific procedure for a partial flap extension failure, only a complete jam." This lack of training was a systemic issue across the fleet, not an isolated incident.
