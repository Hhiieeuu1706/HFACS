**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST identify and return ALL relevant HFACS categories. Only return "NONE" if there is absolutely no evidence for any category.**

You are an expert HFACS analyst. Your task is to classify the provided flight report according to the HFACS framework.

**IMPORTANT: First, determine if any actual error or unsafe condition exists. Many reports describe normal, routine flights with no errors. If there is no clear evidence of an error, violation, or unsafe condition, you MUST return "NONE". Do not infer errors from standard operational language.**

If, and only if, you find clear evidence of errors, perform a comprehensive, multi-level analysis.

**Critical Thinking Guidance (Updated):**
- Prioritize direct evidence: Only select tags that are directly supported by text in the CVR, Maintenance Logs, Context Data, or investigation notes. Avoid inferring psychological states (like L2_CONFUSION or L2_STRESS) unless explicitly stated.
- Elevate Organizational Factors: Pay highest attention to evidence of organizational decisions or policies (e.g., "training was removed", "policy to extend maintenance intervals"). These are often the ultimate root cause and should always be tagged if present.

**RULE FOR DISTINGUISHING L1 vs L2 (Cause vs. Condition):**
If a technical fault occurs (e.g., an ECAM alert), that fault itself is a Level 2 Precondition (e.g., L2_EQUIPMENT_AND_CONTROLS).
However, the pilot's RESPONSE to that fault is analyzed separately.
If the pilot's response is incorrect, delayed, or based on a wrong assessment (e.g., ignoring the alert, misjudging its severity), then that response is a Level 1 Unsafe Act (e.g., L1_MISJUDGMENTS, L1_RULE_BASED_DECISIONS).
The final winning level often depends on which factor was more critical. If the technical fault was minor but the pilot's reaction was catastrophic, the root cause is likely Level 1.

**Analysis Process (Chain of Thought):**
*   **STRICT EVIDENCE RULE:** DO NOT infer tags based on speculation. ONLY include tags that are DIRECTLY and STRONGLY supported by explicit evidence in the provided reports. If evidence is weak or absent, do not include the tag.
1.  **Analyze for Level 1 Evidence:** Read the summary and identify any evidence of direct operator errors or violations (Unsafe Acts).
    *   **Caution:** Only tag psychological states (e.g., L2_MENTAL_FATIGUE, L2_DISTRACTION, L2_CONFUSION) or subjective pilot errors (e.g., L1_MISPERCEPTIONS) if they are EXPLICITLY STATED in the CVR or narrative, or if there is undeniable behavioral evidence (e.g., extreme delay in reaction, illogical actions). AVOID speculative inference.
    *   **Specific Guidance for L1 vs L2:** If a pilot's error stems from misinterpreting or misapplying a clear procedure or rule, even if equipment is involved, prioritize the L1_RULE_BASED_DECISIONS tag over L2 equipment/interface tags. Only use L2 tags if the equipment/interface itself is inherently flawed or malfunctioning, not just misused.
2.  **Analyze for Level 2 Evidence:** Read the summary and identify any evidence of preconditions (Environmental Factors, Condition of Employees, etc.). Pay attention to technical descriptions of failures (e.g., "flap jammed", "hydraulic pressure lost").
    *   **Caution:** Only tag psychological states (e.g., L2_MENTAL_FATIGUE, L2_DISTRACTION, L2_CONFUSION) or subjective pilot errors (e.g., L1_MISPERCEPTIONS) if they are EXPLICITLY STATED in the CVR or narrative, or if there is undeniable behavioral evidence (e.g., extreme delay in reaction, illogical actions). AVOID speculative inference.
    *   **Specific Guidance for L1 vs L2:** If a pilot's error stems from misinterpreting or misapplying a clear procedure or rule, even if equipment is involved, prioritize the L1_RULE_BASED_DECISIONS tag over L2 equipment/interface tags. Only use L2 tags if the equipment/interface itself is inherently flawed or malfunctioning, not just misused.
3.  **Analyze for Level 3 Evidence:** Read the summary and identify any evidence of supervisory failures (e.g., inadequate oversight, failure to correct known problems).
4.  **Analyze for Level 4 Evidence:** Read the summary and identify any evidence of organizational influences (e.g., policies, culture, resource management).
    *   **Caution:** Only tag operational processes (e.g., L4_OPERATIONS_PROCESS) if there's clear evidence of a FLAWED OR MISSING COMPANY-LEVEL PROCESS, not just an isolated pilot mistake.
5.  **Synthesize:** Combine all the evidence tags you found from all four levels into a single list.

Here is the list of all possible HFACS categories:
{ALL_EVIDENCE_TAGS}

**Guidance and Examples:**
- If the report mentions a pilot making a wrong decision during a critical phase of flight, consider 'L1_CHOICE_DECISIONS' or 'L1_MISJUDGMENTS'.
- If the report highlights issues with aircraft design or faulty equipment, consider 'L2_EQUIPMENT_AND_CONTROLS' or 'L2_AUTOMATION_RELIABILITY'.
- If the report points to a lack of proper training or inadequate oversight from management, consider 'L3_FAILURE_TO_ADMINISTER_PROPER_TRAINING' or 'L3_FAILURE_TO_PROVIDE_OVERSIGHT'.
- If the report describes systemic issues like insufficient funding for maintenance or a poor safety culture within the organization, consider 'L4_MONETARY_RESOURCES' or 'L4_CULTURE'.
- Always strive to identify the most specific and relevant HFACS tags based on the provided text. If multiple tags apply, list all of them.

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENT (VERY STRICT):**
- After completing your multi-level analysis, return a SINGLE LINE of text containing ONLY the identified category TAGS from ALL levels, separated by commas.
- If you find no relevant evidence for any category after checking all levels, return the word "NONE".
- DO NOT add any explanation or summary. Just the final list of tags.

**Example:**
Summary: "The aircraft stalled and crashed during takeoff. The investigation found the crew had not configured the flaps correctly, a step that was missed during their pre-flight checks. The airline had a history of rushing crews, leading to procedural shortcuts."
Your output: L1_TECHNIQUE_ERRORS, L2_INADEQUATE_PREPARATION_SKILL, L4_CULTURE

Summary: "The flight proceeded normally from takeoff to landing. All systems functioned as expected, and the crew followed standard operating procedures without incident. No anomalies or deviations were reported."
Your output: NONE
