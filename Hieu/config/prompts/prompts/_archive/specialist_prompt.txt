**--- HFACS CODING MANUAL ---**
**Follow these inclusion and exclusion rules with absolute precision.**

**LEVEL 4: ORGANIZATIONAL INFLUENCES** (Highest priority - check first)
*   **Definition:** Latent failures related to high-level management decisions, policies, and culture.
*   **INCLUSION RULE:** ALWAYS tag Level 4 categories if there is ANY direct evidence of:
    *   Resource Management issues: Mention of "cost-cutting", "staffing shortages", "inadequate budget", "outdated equipment". (Tags: `L4_MONETARY_RESOURCES`, `L4_HUMAN_RESOURCES`, `L4_EQUIPMENT_FACILITY_RESOURCES`)
    *   Organizational Climate issues: Mention of "pressure to meet schedule", "production over safety", a "poor safety culture", conflicting goals or policies. (Tags: `L4_CULTURE`, `L4_POLICIES`)
    *   Operational Process issues: Mention of flawed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), inadequate maintenance processes, or removal of critical training from the syllabus. (Tags: `L4_OPERATIONS_PROCESS`, `L4_PROCEDURES_PROCESS`)

**LEVEL 3: UNSAFE SUPERVISION**
*   **Definition:** Latent failures related to direct supervisors and line management.
*   **INCLUSION RULE for `L3_FAILURE_TO_CORRECT_A_SAFETY_HAZARD`:** ONLY tag this if there is a specific, documented entry in the Maintenance Logs about a known, unresolved technical issue that was deferred or inadequately addressed.
*   **INCLUSION RULE for `L3_FAILURE_TO_ADMINISTER_PROPER_TRAINING`:** ONLY tag this if there is a specific mention of training deficiencies (e.g., "we were never trained for this").
*   **INCLUSION RULE for `L3_AUTHORIZED_UNQUALIFIED_CREW_FOR_FLIGHT`:** ONLY tag if there is direct evidence a crew member was known to be unqualified or not current.
*   **EXCLUSION RULE:** Do not assume supervisory failure. There must be a clear action or inaction documented (e.g., a specific decision to defer maintenance).

**LEVEL 2: PRECONDITIONS FOR UNSAFE ACTS**
*   **Definition:** Latent conditions of the operator or the environment that enabled the unsafe act.
*   **INCLUSION RULE for Environmental Factors:** Tag `L2_WEATHER` or `L2_LIGHTING` only if the report explicitly states they were a challenging factor (e.g., "low visibility", "strong crosswind", "night").
*   **INCLUSION RULE for Crew Conditions (Physiological/Mental):**
    *   Tag `L2_PHYSICAL_FATIGUE` or `L2_MENTAL_FATIGUE` ONLY if there is direct evidence: long duty hours, crew mentioning tiredness, or a significant, documented delay in reaction time (e.g., "> 5 seconds").
    *   Tag `L2_INADEQUATE_PREPARATION_SKILL` if there is evidence of a knowledge gap that is NOT due to a systemic training failure (Level 4/3).
*   **EXCLUSION RULE for Crew Conditions:** DO NOT infer psychological states like `L2_CONFUSION`, `L2_DISTRACTION`, `L2_STRESS`, or `L2_OVERCONFIDENCE` unless there is explicit, direct evidence in the CVR or narrative (e.g., non-essential chatter, pilot stating "I'm overwhelmed").

**LEVEL 1: UNSAFE ACTS**
*   **Definition:** The specific, observable actions of the operator that were the direct cause of the incident.
*   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag Level 1 errors or violations ONLY if they are the clear, proximate cause of the event.
    *   `L1_TECHNIQUE_ERRORS`: A correct procedure was performed incorrectly (e.g., "over-corrected", "landed too fast").
    *   `L1_CHOICE_DECISIONS`: A bad decision was made when multiple options were available (e.g., "decided to continue into bad weather").
    *   `L1_VIOLATION_OF_ORDERS_SOPS`: A known rule was deliberately or unintentionally broken.
*   **CRITICAL EXCLUSION RULE:** **DO NOT** tag any pilot action as a Level 1 Unsafe Act if it is a reasonable and expected **reaction** to a sudden, unforeseen technical failure or environmental condition. A Level 1 Unsafe Act must be a *cause*, not a *consequence*.

**--- END OF MANUAL ---**

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENT (VERY STRICT):**
- Based ONLY on the manual above, return a SINGLE LINE of text containing all identified category TAGS, separated by commas.
- If no rules are met, return "NONE".
