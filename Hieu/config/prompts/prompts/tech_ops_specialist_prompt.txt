**CODING MANUAL FOR TECHNICAL & OPERATIONS SPECIALIST:**
Focus ONLY on evidence related to direct pilot actions (Level 1) or environmental/technical conditions (Level 2).

**RULE FOR DISTINGUISHING L1 vs L2 (Cause vs. Condition):**
If a technical fault occurs (e.g., an ECAM alert), that fault itself is a Level 2 Precondition (e.g., L2_EQUIPMENT_AND_CONTROLS).
However, the pilot's RESPONSE to that fault is analyzed separately.
If the pilot's response is incorrect, delayed, or based on a wrong assessment (e.g., ignoring the alert, misjudging its severity), then that response is a Level 1 Unsafe Act (e.g., L1_MISJUDGMENTS, L1_RULE_BASED_DECISIONS).
The final winning level often depends on which factor was more critical. If the technical fault was minor but the pilot's reaction was catastrophic, the root cause is likely Level 1.

--- **LEVEL 1: UNSAFE ACTS - DETAILED CODING MANUAL** ---
**Definition:** Direct, observable actions or inactions of the operator that are the proximate cause of the incident. These are the immediate "causes" of the accident.

**1. L1_ILL_STRUCTURED_DECISIONS**
    *   **Definition:** Decisions made in ambiguous, unfamiliar situations where standard procedures or clear solutions are absent. The pilot must infer, estimate, or extrapolate.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report describes a decision in a novel, ill-defined situation where the correct course of action was not clear from training or SOPs, and the pilot's decision led to the mishap.
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if the pilot simply made a wrong choice from clear options, or if a procedure existed but was misapplied.

**2. L1_CHOICE_DECISIONS**
    *   **Definition:** Deliberate selections between clearly defined options, where the pilot selects an option that proves to be unsafe. There were other, safer choices available.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report explicitly states the pilot chose an unsafe option when a safer, clear alternative existed (e.g., "pilot chose to land with unlatched gear," "pilot decided to fly into known severe weather").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if the decision was made under extreme time pressure, or if the consequences were genuinely unknown.

**3. L1_RULE_BASED_DECISIONS**
    *   **Definition:** Errors in applying a learned rule or procedure to a familiar situation. The pilot correctly identifies the situation but misapplies the rule.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report describes the pilot misapplying a standard rule or checklist procedure (e.g., "pilot used wrong checklist for engine fire," "misinterpreted the meaning of the warning light").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if the rule itself was flawed (that's a Level 4 issue) or if the pilot was never trained on the rule.

**4. L1_ATTENTION_FAILURES**
    *   **Definition:** Breakdown in vigilance or focus, leading to the pilot missing critical cues or inputs. This includes distraction, channelized attention, or inattention.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report explicitly states pilot distraction (e.g., "pilot was distracted by passenger," "focused only on airspeed and missed altimeter"), or a clear lack of vigilance directly contributing to the mishap.
    *   **CRITICAL EXCLUSION RULE:** **DO NOT** use this tag if the "distraction" or "lack of attention" is merely a *consequence* of a sudden, overwhelming event (e.g., ECAM alert). A pilot reacting to an emergency is not an attention failure.

**5. L1_MEMORY_FAILURES**
    *   **Definition:** Forgetting to perform a specific action or recall critical information. This includes prospective memory (forgetting to do something) and retrospective memory (forgetting facts).
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report explicitly states the pilot *forgot* a specific action or piece of information critical to safety (e.g., "pilot forgot to lower landing gear," "forgot minimum safe altitude").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if the pilot *knew* but *chose* not to perform the action (that's a violation or decision error).

**6. L1_TECHNIQUE_ERRORS**
    *   **Definition:** Failure in the execution of a learned skill or physical manipulation, despite correct intention. A "slip" or "lapse" in motor control.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report describes a physical error in execution (e.g., "over-corrected rudder", "landed too hard", "mismanaged power settings during climb").
    *   **CRITICAL EXCLUSION RULE:** **DO NOT** tag any pilot action as a Level 1 Unsafe Act if it is a reasonable and expected *reaction* to a sudden, unforeseen technical failure or environmental condition. A Level 1 Unsafe Act must be a *cause*, not a *consequence*.

**7. L1_MISPERCEPTIONS**
    *   **Definition:** Failure to correctly interpret sensory information (visual, auditory, tactile). The pilot "sees" or "hears" something but understands it incorrectly.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report EXPLICITLY states a sensory misinterpretation (e.g., "pilot thought the runway was closer due to fog," "misinterpreted the sound of the engine," "spatial disorientation," "visual illusion").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if the pilot simply made a mistake in judgment or decision-making, or if the perception was correct but the subsequent action was wrong.
    *   **CRITICAL EXCLUSION RULE: ABSOLUTELY DO NOT use this tag for a pilot's reaction to a clear and sudden technical failure. A misperception is when the pilot's senses deceive them before the failure, not when they are reacting to it. Only use this tag if there is explicit evidence like 'spatial disorientation' or 'visual illusion'.**

**8. L1_MISJUDGMENTS**
    *   **Definition:** Incorrect assessment of a situation, risk, or condition. The pilot gathers information but forms a flawed conclusion. This is a cognitive error, distinct from a decision error (which is about choice).
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report describes a pilot's flawed assessment of a situation's parameters (e.g., "misjudged altitude/distance/speed," "underestimated crosswind component," "overestimated aircraft performance").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if the judgment was based on incorrect information provided by others (that's a communication error).

**9. L1_FAILED_TO_COMPLY_MANUALS**
    *   **Definition:** Violation of regulations, company policies, or standard operating procedures (SOPs) as documented in manuals. This implies awareness of the rule.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report clearly states the pilot did not follow a documented manual, regulation, or SOP (e.g., "did not adhere to minimum fuel requirements," "ignored cold weather pre-flight checks in manual").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if the manual itself was flawed (Level 4) or if the pilot was unaware of the manual.

**10. L1_VIOLATED_TRAINING_RULES**
    *   **Definition:** Deviation from established training standards or practices that were taught.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report indicates the pilot knowingly or unknowingly deviated from specific training protocols (e.g., "performed a maneuver not taught or contrary to training," "did not maintain a specific parameter as instructed in training").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if the training itself was insufficient (Level 3).

**11. L1_VIOLATION_OF_ORDERS_SOPS**
    *   **Definition:** Deliberate or non-deliberate breach of specific orders or standard operating procedures (SOPs).
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report explicitly states a deviation from a specific command or company-level SOP (e.g., "pilot ignored the flight director's climb instruction," "did not follow company's checklist for engine start").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if the SOP itself was outdated or flawed (Level 4).

**12. L1_PERFORMED_UNAUTHORIZED_OPERATION**
    *   **Definition:** Operating the aircraft in a manner or condition not permitted by regulations or company policy.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report clearly indicates an operation outside of legal or company authorization (e.g., "flew into restricted airspace without clearance," "operated aircraft beyond its certified weight limits").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if the unauthorized operation was due to a misunderstanding of a new rule (Level 2).

**13. L1_ACCEPTED_UNAUTHORIZED_HAZARD**
    *   **Definition:** A pilot knowingly proceeds with a flight despite being aware of an unauthorized or excessive risk.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report shows the pilot consciously chose to proceed into a known, unacceptable hazard (e.g., "pilot took off with a known critical system malfunction," "proceeded into severe icing despite warnings").
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if the pilot was unaware of the hazard.

**14. L1_NOT_CURRENT_QUALIFIED_VIOLATION**
    *   **Definition:** Operating an aircraft without being current (recent flight experience) or qualified (holding proper certifications/ratings) as required by regulations.
    *   **INCLUSION RULE:** Tag ONLY if the report states the pilot was not current (e.g., "pilot exceeded allowed time since last landing," "did not have required night flight hours") or not properly qualified for the type of operation.
    *   **EXCLUSION RULE:** DO NOT use if the pilot was qualified but received insufficient training.

Example Scenario: skill_based_error
Report: During a routine landing, the pilot over-corrected on the rudder during the flare, causing a hard landing and minor structural damage. The pilot had extensive experience but simply made a physical error in execution.
HFACS Tags: L1_TECHNIQUE_ERRORS

Example Scenario: fatigue_perception_error
Report: The pilot, having flown a demanding schedule for the past week with minimal rest, misperceived the aircraft's altitude during a night approach, leading to a premature descent. While there was a minor, pre-existing maintenance issue with the altimeter's backlighting, the primary contributing factor was the pilot's severe fatigue affecting their perception.
